## Overview

### Where Physical Media Reigns  

**Rewind the Past. Collect the Future.**

## User Experience Design

### Project Structure

---

For this project, I've chosen a non-standard folder structure that I believe is more effective and easier to navigate than the typical Django layout. All Django apps are organised within a dedicated subfolder named `apps`, inside the main project directory.

This approach keeps the project structure tidy, and makes it easier to locate and manage individual apps - resulting in a clearer and more maintainable codebase.

### Project Board

The entire implementation process was guided through a dedicated GitHub [project board](https://github.com/users/dvfrancis/projects/4). Amongst other things, it was used to track tasks, feature additions, bugs, and user stories.

<details>
<summary>Click to view a screenshot of the project board</summary>
            
![Project board](assets/images/milestone-four-project-board-overview.webp)
</details>

Each task was assigned to a milestone, with relevant labels and [MoSCoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method) categories.

The MoSCoW project split was as follows:

| Type | Total | % Total |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Must Have | 55 | 60% |
| Should Have | 18 | 20% |
| Could Have | 3 | 3% |
| Won't Have | 5 | 5% |
| Uncategorised | 11 | 12% |
| TOTALS | 92 | 100% |

- "What is The Cult Film Club about?”
- "What films are available?"
- “Which films are classed as 'Cult Classics'?”
- "How much do different films cost?"
- “Does the website accept discount codes?”
- "Do I get rewarded for multiple purchases?"

- "How many loyalty points do I have?"
- "How many copies are available of a particular film?"
- "Can I get priority shipping for my purchase?"
- "Do you have a website newsletter I can join?"

|Issue|Item|Description|
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [#24](https://github.com/dvfrancis/the-cult-film-club/issues/24) | Django admin portal customisation | Adjust the style and content of the portal to fit better with the site |
| [#64](https://github.com/dvfrancis/the-cult-film-club/issues/64) | Newsletter subscriptions | Although the site takes user's details for a newsletter, the newsletter itself is not actually produced so this functionality would be nice to implement |
| [#65](https://github.com/dvfrancis/the-cult-film-club/issues/65) | User forum | Implementing a user forum would help build a sense of community on the site |
| [#86](https://github.com/dvfrancis/the-cult-film-club/issues/86) | Loyalty points | Allow users to collect points when buying items, and then redeem them against future purchases |
| [#89](https://github.com/dvfrancis/the-cult-film-club/issues/89) | Alternative shipping types and providers | Give users the option to choose what type of shipping they'd like and also the shipping provider |

For this final project, I chose a minimal design approach, using a limited colour palette, a single font, and a clean, crisp layout. This aesthetic reflects the cult ethos of the website, allowing the content and unique character of each film to stand out without distraction.

The restrained use of colour and simple visual elements create a focused, user-friendly experience that feels both modern and timeless. By prioritising clarity and simplicity, the site remains accessible and visually appealing, ensuring that users can easily browse, discover, and appreciate the curated collection of cult films that form 'The Cult Film Club'.

#### Colours

    - Crimson (#ca0000)
    - Orange (#ff7900)
    - Amber (#ffb700)

#### Typography

The following font (from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)) was used for the entire site:
  
- [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway)

#### Media

- Images used on the website are served by [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).

- The images used by the README.md and TESTING.md documents are stored in the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dvfrancis/the-cult-film-club).

- User profile images were generated using AI from [This Person Does Not Exist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/), a website that creates random, anonymous facial images.

- The following images are only used when no film release or user profile image is available:

#### Content

The initial content for this site was created using [Microsoft CoPilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/), which served as a helpful starting point. I thoroughly reviewed and refined the generated material to ensure it perfectly matched the site’s tone, style, and specific needs.

Additionally, CoPilot was also used to compile a comprehensive list of films, which I carefully curated and edited it to maintain accuracy and relevance.

All other material on the site was created independently by myself to provide a fully tailored and authentic experience.

#### Deploying Locally

To deploy the project locally, follow these steps:

##### 1. Clone / download the repository

You can copy the GitHub repository locally in one of two ways:

- **Option 1**: Download the ZIP file from the repository page and extract it to a folder on your computer.
- **Option 2**: Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dvfrancis/the-cult-film-club.git
```
##### 2. Install dependencies

Open a terminal window, in the root project folder, and install all required packages:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
##### 3. Setup environment variables

Create a file named `.gitignore` in the project root (if it doesn't already exist), and add the following entries. This ensures sensitive data (passwords, etc) are not tracked by Git:

```bash
env.py
__pycache__/
```
Then create a file named `env.py` in the root directory and add your environment variables (while developing, leave `DEBUG=True`, but before deployment make sure to set `DEBUG=False`:

```python
import os

os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = 'Add your secret key'
os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = 'Add your database URL'
os.environ['DEBUG'] = 'True'
...other environment variables
```
##### 4. Migrate the database

Run the following commands to apply changes to the relevant database tables:

```bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```

##### 5. Create the superuser account

Set up an admin account by running the command shown below, and following the prompts to complete superuser creation:

```bash
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

##### 6. Run the development server

Start the Django development server and then `Ctrl` + `Click` on Windows (or `Cmd` + `Click` on macOS) the URL displayed in the terminal, to open the site in your browser:

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

##### 7. Access the admin panel

To access the Django Admin interface:

- Append `/admin` to the local URL in your browser.
- Log in using the superuser credentials you previously created.

You will now have full access to manage users, products, content, and more via the admin portal.

#### Deploying Remotely

Follow these steps to deploy your Django project to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/):

##### 1. Push Changes to GitHub

Make sure all changes are committed and pushed to your GitHub repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Heroku deployment"
git push
```
##### 2. Create a Heroku account and app

- Go to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) and sign up (or log in).
- In the Heroku Dashboard, click 'New' > 'Create new app'.
- Give your app a unique name, and choose your region.

##### 3. Create a `Procfile`

In your local project root directory, create a file named Procfile (no extension) and add the following line:

```bash
web: gunicorn <your_app_name>.wsgi:application
```
Replace `<your_app_name>` with the name of your Django project (the folder containing `settings.py`). Don’t forget to commit and push this file to GitHub after creating it.

##### 4. Configure environment variables on Heroku

In your Heroku app dashboard:

- Navigate to 'Settings' > 'Reveal Config Vars'.
- Add the following key-value pairs:

| Key | Value |
| --- | ----- |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | `1` (disables the collectstatic build step during development - delete before deployment)
| `DATABASE_URL` | Your database URL
| `SECRET_KEY` | Your Django secret key
| `EMAIL_USER` | Email address (from your email provider)
| `EMAIL_PASSWORD` | Email password (from your email provider)
| `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` | Used to identify your account with Stripe
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Allows your app to interact securely with Stripe services
| `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` | A secret string used to verify webhook events sent from Stripe

If you're using services like Cloudinary or Amazon Web Services, add the corresponding variables here too (for example, `CLOUDINARY_URL`).


##### 5. Set local environment variables

In your local `env.py` file, add your environment variables using:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("KEY", "VALUE")
...other environment variables
```

Replace `KEY` and `VALUE` with your actual config keys and values.

##### 6. Apply migrations

Run the following commands locally to set up your database schema:

```bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```

##### 7. Update Django settings

In `settings.py`, set:

```python
DEBUG = False
```
Commit and push this change to GitHub.

##### 8. Connect Heroku to GitHub

- In the Heroku app dashboard, go to the 'Deploy' tab.
- Under Deployment method, select 'GitHub'.
- Search for, and then connect, your repository.
- Click 'Deploy Branch' to begin deployment.

Optionally, enable automatic deploys so Heroku redeploys on every push to the `main` or `master` branch.

##### 9. Final deployment steps

When you're ready to finalise your project:
- Double-check in `settings.py` that `DEBUG = False`.
- Remove `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` from your Heroku Config Vars.
- Commit any final changes to GitHub.
- Re-deploy from the Heroku dashboard

Once deployed, your app should be live on Heroku. Visit your app URL and add `/admin` to access the Django admin panel using your superuser credentials.
