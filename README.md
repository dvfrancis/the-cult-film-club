## User Experience Design

### Project Structure

---

For this project, I've chosen a non-standard folder structure that I believe is more effective and easier to navigate than the typical Django layout. All Django apps are organised within a dedicated subfolder named `apps`, inside the main project directory.

This approach keeps the project structure tidy, and makes it easier to locate and manage individual apps - resulting in a clearer and more maintainable codebase.

### Project Board

The entire implementation process was guided through a dedicated GitHub [project board](https://github.com/users/dvfrancis/projects/4) which was used to track tasks, feature additions, bugs, and user stories.

</details>

Custom issue templates were also created to use during project development.

<details>

Each task was assigned to a milestone, with relevant labels and [MoSCoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method) categories.

- Improve shopping experience via an easy but secure checkout process, user interface optimisation, and fast and reliable shipping (including free delivery for large orders).
- Expand market reach and brand awareness through digital marketing and SEO practices, partnering with film distributors, and building a name in forums, on social media, and in film communities.
- Establish a sustainable business model through streamlined inventory management, cost-effective supply chain, and exploration of subscription models.

#### Key User Goals

- Connect with other film enthusiasts by sharing film information on social media, and discovering hidden gems based on user ratings and reviews.
- Shop with confidence via a hassle-free checkout experience utilising a secure, reliable payment service.

#### User Experience

- Target audience may:
    - Be film enthusiasts (aged 18+) who appreciate unconventional, offbeat, and genre-defining films.
    - Include users who identify as a cult cinema enthusiast, serious / casual collector, fan of a specific genre, person driven by nostalgia, movie buff, social sharer, member of an alternative subculture communities.
    - Have an interest in rare or limited edition releases.
    - Value physical ownership over digital streaming.
    - Engage in movie discussions, reviews, and fan theories.
 
#### User Expectations

- A carefully curated, wide selection of authentic cult films, including rare editions.
- A smooth, engaging, and visually appealing browsing experience with intuitive navigation and comprehensive search / filtering functionality.
- Comprehensive and engaging product descriptions.
- Secure and hassle-free shopping experience with orders processed efficiently via a secure checkout.

- Reliable customer service through responsive support, and efficient handling of returns and refunds.

#### User Stories

##### First time visitor goals

First-time visitors to The Cult Film Club will likely have different goals compared to returning customers or seasoned collectors:

- "What is The Cult Film Club about?”
- "What films are available?"
- “Which films are classed as 'Cult Classics'?”
- "How much do different films cost?"
- “Does the website accept discount codes?”
- "How do other users of the site rate the films?"
        
##### Returning visitor goals

Returning visitors to The Cult Film Club will likely have already explored the site, so their goals will be more focused on engagement, purchases, and expanding their collection:
    
- “What new films are available?”
- "Is it possible to bookmark films for later purchase?"
- "How do I share my favourite films with others?"
- "How do I pay for my purchases?"
- "Where can I see a list of my orders?"
    
##### Frequent visitor goals

Frequent visitors to The Cult Film Club will have more refined goals than first-time or returning visitors. These users are highly engaged and probably see the site as their go-to destination for cult cinema:
    
- "Are there any special, or limited editions available?"
- "How many copies are available of a particular film?"
- "Does my order qualify for free shipping?"
- "Do you have a website newsletter I can join?"

| [#65](https://github.com/dvfrancis/the-cult-film-club/issues/65) | User forum | Implementing a user forum would help build a sense of community on the site |
| [#86](https://github.com/dvfrancis/the-cult-film-club/issues/86) | Loyalty points | Allow users to collect points when buying items, and then redeem them against future purchases |

#### C R U D

Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) capabilities for each database model are shown in the following table. I believe this demonstrates that full CRUD has been achieved across the project:

| **MODEL** | **CREATE** | **READ** | **UPDATE** | **DELETE**  |
|-----------|-------------|-------|------------|----------|
| *User*| Create a user account | View user account | Update user account | Delete user account (and all associated data) |

#### Wireframes

My initial wireframe concepts for website pages are shown below. During development, numerous additional pages were created beyond these initial designs, including a product management interface, user profile section, and various administrative features. While these additional pages are not represented in the original wireframes, they all maintained consistent design principles and structural elements established in these foundational layouts.

### Surface

For this final project, I chose a minimal design approach, using a limited colour palette, a single font, and a clean, crisp layout. This aesthetic reflects the cult ethos of the website, allowing the content and unique character of each film to stand out without distraction.

The restrained use of colour and simple visual elements create a focused, user-friendly experience that feels both modern and timeless. By prioritising clarity and simplicity, the site remains accessible and visually appealing, ensuring that users can easily browse, discover, and appreciate the curated collection of cult films that form 'The Cult Film Club'.

#### Colours

</details>

- The website colour scheme was taken from the Sarah Renae Clarke Colour Catalogue: Volume 2, colour palette 251:
    - White (#FFF)
    - Black (#080808)
    - Crimson (#CA0000)
    - Orange (#FF7900)
    - Amber (#FFB700) 
    - Platinum (#E1E1E3)
- Some button colours are taken from Bootstrap's default button classes.

#### Typography

The following font (from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)) was used for the entire site:
  
- [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway)

#### Media

- Images used on the website are served by [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).

- The images used by the README.md and TESTING.md documents are stored in the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dvfrancis/the-cult-film-club).

- User profile images were generated using AI from [This Person Does Not Exist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/), a website that creates random, anonymous facial images.

- The following images are only used when no film release or user profile image is available:

    - Film release holding image - [Film release holding image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvzs9gve0/image/upload/v1748259124/holding_image.webp)

#### Content

Initial content for this site was created, in part, by using [Microsoft CoPilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/), which served as a helpful starting point. I thoroughly reviewed and refined the generated material to ensure it matched the site’s tone, style, and requirements.

Additionally, CoPilot was also used to compile a comprehensive list of films, which I carefully curated and edited to maintain accuracy and relevance.

All other material on the site was created independently by myself to provide a fully tailored and authentic experience.

#### Deploying Locally

To deploy the project locally, follow these steps:

##### 1. Clone / download the repository

You can copy the GitHub repository locally in one of two ways:

- **Option 1**: Download the ZIP file from the repository page and extract it to a folder on your computer.
- **Option 2**: Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dvfrancis/the-cult-film-club.git
```
##### 2. Install dependencies

Open a terminal window, in the root project folder, and install all required packages:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
##### 3. Setup environment variables

Create a file named `.gitignore` in the project root (if it doesn't already exist), and add the following entries. This ensures sensitive data (passwords, etc) are not tracked by Git:

```bash
env.py
__pycache__/
```
Then create a file named `env.py` in the root directory and add your environment variables (while developing, leave `DEBUG=True`, but before deployment make sure to set `DEBUG=False`:

```python
import os

os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = 'Add your secret key'
os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = 'Add your database URL'
os.environ['DEBUG'] = 'True'
...other environment variables
```
##### 4. Migrate the database

Run the following commands to apply changes to the relevant database tables:

```bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```

##### 5. Create the superuser account

Set up an admin account by running the command shown below, and following the prompts to complete superuser creation:

```bash
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

##### 6. Run the development server

Start the Django development server and then `Ctrl` + `Click` on Windows (or `Cmd` + `Click` on macOS) the URL displayed in the terminal, to open the site in your browser:

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

##### 7. Access the admin panel

To access the Django Admin interface:

- Append `/admin` to the local URL in your browser.
- Log in using the superuser credentials you previously created.

You will now have full access to manage users, products, content, and more via the admin portal.

#### Deploying Remotely

Follow these steps to deploy your Django project to Heroku:

##### 1. Push Changes to GitHub

Make sure all changes are committed and pushed to your GitHub repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Heroku deployment"
git push
```
##### 2. Create a Heroku account and app

- Go to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) and sign up (or log in).
- In the Heroku Dashboard, click 'New' > 'Create new app'.
- Give your app a unique name, and choose your region.

##### 3. Create a `Procfile`

In your local project root directory, create a file named Procfile (no extension) and add the following line:

```bash
web: gunicorn <your_app_name>.wsgi:application
```
Replace `<your_app_name>` with the name of your Django project (the folder containing `settings.py`). Don’t forget to commit and push this file to GitHub after creating it.

##### 4. Configure environment variables on Heroku

In your Heroku app dashboard:

- Navigate to 'Settings' > 'Reveal Config Vars'.
- Add the following key-value pairs:

| Key | Value |
| --- | ----- |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | `1` (disables the collectstatic build step during development - delete before deployment)
| `DATABASE_URL` | Your database URL
| `SECRET_KEY` | Your Django secret key
| `EMAIL_USER` | Email address (from your email provider)
| `EMAIL_PASSWORD` | Email password (from your email provider)
| `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` | Used to identify your account with Stripe
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Allows your app to interact securely with Stripe services
| `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` | A secret string used to verify webhook events sent from Stripe

If you're using services like Cloudinary or Amazon Web Services, add the corresponding variables here too (for example, `CLOUDINARY_URL`).


##### 5. Set local environment variables

In your local `env.py` file, add your environment variables using:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("KEY", "VALUE")
...other environment variables
```

Replace `KEY` and `VALUE` with your actual config keys and values.

##### 6. Apply migrations

Run the following commands locally to set up your database schema:

```bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```

##### 7. Update Django settings

In `settings.py`, set:

```python
DEBUG = False
```
Commit and push this change to GitHub.

##### 8. Connect Heroku to GitHub

- In the Heroku app dashboard, go to the 'Deploy' tab.
- Under Deployment method, select 'GitHub'.
- Search for, and then connect, your repository.
- Click 'Deploy Branch' to begin deployment.

Optionally, enable automatic deploys so Heroku redeploys on every push to the `main` or `master` branch.

##### 9. Final deployment steps

When you're ready to finalise your project:
- Double-check in `settings.py` that `DEBUG = False`.
- Remove `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` from your Heroku Config Vars.
- Commit any final changes to GitHub.
- Re-deploy from the Heroku dashboard

Once deployed, your app should be live on Heroku. Visit your app URL and add `/admin` to access the Django admin panel using your superuser credentials.
