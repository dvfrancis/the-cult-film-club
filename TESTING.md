## Code Validation

### HTML

- The [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org) was used to check all HTML. The code for each page was validated by direct input of the code copied from each rendered page. Click to view the [HTML report](documentation/validation/html-report.pdf).

- I did not test base.html directly, as it is a part of all other pages.

### CSS

- The [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) was used to check base.css. Click to view the [CSS report](documentation/validation/css-report.pdf).

### JavaScript

- [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) was used to check base.js. Click to view the [JavaScript report](documentation/validation/javascript-report.pdf).

### Python

- The [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) was used to check all Python code. Click to view the [Python report](documentation/validation/python-report.pdf).

## Manual Validation

The base.html page is not included here as it is validated as part of all other pages.

## Accessibility

The [Wave Accessibility Evaluation Tool (WAVE)](https://wave.webaim.org) was used to create an [accessibility report](documentation/accessibility/accessibility-report.pdf) for this project.

## Responsiveness

Pages were going to be assessed using the [Responsive Web Design Checker](https://responsivedesignchecker.com/) but, unfortunately, the site won't load there. Instead, they have been presented using the [Responsive Viewer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/responsive-viewer/inmopeiepgfljkpkidclfgbgbmfcennb?hl=en-GB&utm_source=ext_sidebar) Google Chrome browser plugin.

Pages were tested for responsiveness on mobile (Apple iPhone 14 - 390px x 844px), tablet (Apple iPad Air 5 - 820px x 1180px), and desktop (MacBook Pro 16 - 1728px x 1117px).

Click here to see the [Responsiveness report](documentation/validation/responsiveness/responsiveness-report.pdf)

## Performance

Both mobile and desktop page performance was assessed with [Google Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/).
