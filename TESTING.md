## Code Validation

### HTML

- The [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org) was used to check all HTML. The code for each page was validated by direct input of the code copied from each rendered page. Click to view the [HTML report](documentation/validation/html-report.pdf).

- I did not test base.html directly, as it is a part of all other pages.

- There are also four include files used for different Toast messages throughout the site (toast_error.html, toast_info.html, toast_success.html, and toast_warning.html). As these are snippets of HTML they cannot easily be validated using the W3C Markup Validation Service. However, ignoring the errors caused by taking them out of context, all of the snippets passed validation without any errors.

### CSS

- The [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) was used to check base.css. Click to view the [CSS report](documentation/validation/css-report.pdf).

### JavaScript

- [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) was used to check base.js. Click to view the [JavaScript report](documentation/validation/javascript-report.pdf).

### Python

- The [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) was used to check all Python code. Click to view the [Python report](documentation/validation/python-report.pdf).

## Manual Validation

### Permission-dependent pages

The following pages should not be available to general website users, and are only accessible by an account with superuser privileges. For this project, this account is called `su` (and a non-privileged account is `dgreen`). Some of the links shown below relate to specific film releases but would be in the same format for any release, just with the relevant primary key reference at the end.

The base.html page contains the header and footer that is shared by all pages throughout the site. I've added the manual validation for those items below so they need not be repeated across every single page detailed in this section.

## Accessibility

The [Wave Accessibility Evaluation Tool (WAVE)](https://wave.webaim.org) was used to create an [accessibility report](documentation/accessibility/accessibility-report.pdf) for this project.

## Responsiveness

The site won't load in the [Responsive Web Design Checker](https://responsivedesignchecker.com/) so I've used the Google Chrome plugin called [Responsive Viewer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/responsive-viewer/inmopeiepgfljkpkidclfgbgbmfcennb?hl=en-GB&utm_source=ext_sidebar) instead.

Pages were tested for responsiveness at the following sizes:

- Mobile (Apple iPhone 14 - 393px x 852x).
- Tablet (Apple iPad Air 5 - 820px x 1180px).
- Desktop (MacBook Air - 1559px x 975px).

Click here to view the [Responsiveness report](documentation/responsiveness/responsiveness-report.pdf)

## Performance

[Google Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/) was used to assess both mobile and desktop performance.

Some of the pages are suffering a performance hit because of external services provided by Cloudinary and Stripe. In particular, the Stripe cookie appears to have a detrimental effect across the entire site and I have no control over this. Also, although I've specified that all images served by Cloudinary are served over HTTPS, Cloudinary continues to serve them over HTTP; this results in an unfixable console error in the browser.

## Bugs

The numbering of the bugs shown below matches the cases raised on the project board, attached to the GitGub repository, and are linked below. They're named after their GitHub issue number (and are not sequential).

### Resolved

#### [Bug #79](https://github.com/users/dvfrancis/projects/4/views/1?filterQuery=bug&pane=issue&itemId=112365877&issue=dvfrancis%7Cthe-cult-film-club%7C79)

Films should allow ratings from different users, yet currently it only allows one rating per film in total. I changed `title` field from `models.OnetoOneField` to `models.ForeignKey` ,and films can now have multiple ratings and are calculated correctly for display on the page.

The site should only allow one Wishlist per user, but it is possible to create multiple wish lists per user (this functionality was changed later in the project to allow users to have multiple wishlists).

Added the following to the Wishlist model `Meta` class:

```
from django.db.models import UniqueConstraint

    class Meta:
        constraints = [
            UniqueConstraint(fields=['user'], name='unique_user_wishlist')
            # Restricts each user to a single wishlist
        ]
```
Users can no longer create multiple wishlists.

Users should only be able to create one rating per film (and edit that single rating), but currently they can create multiple ratings for a single film.

Added the following restraint to the Rating model `Meta` class:

```   
class Meta:
        unique_together = (
            ('user', 'title'),
        )
```
Users are no longer able to add duplicate ratings for a single film.

When searching images in the admin panel an error occurs.

The issue is that the `title` search_fields in ImageAdmin is a ForeignKey to `Releases`, and Django doesn't support `icontains` lookups on ForeignKey fields directly.

By changing it from

```
@admin.register(Images)
class ImageAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ['title', 'caption']
    list_filter = ['date_added']
    search_fields = ['title', 'caption']
    ordering = ['caption']
```
to 
```
@admin.register(Images)
class ImageAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ['title', 'caption']
    list_filter = ['date_added']
    search_fields = ['title__title', 'caption']
    ordering = ['caption']
```
Django searches within the `title` field of `Releases` model, rather than directly on the ForeignKey `title` in `Images`.

#### [Bug #83](https://github.com/users/dvfrancis/projects/4/views/1?filterQuery=bug&pane=issue&itemId=114170635&issue=dvfrancis%7Cthe-cult-film-club%7C83)

If a user is logged in and requests next day delivery, but then clears all items from the shopping cart, the balance remains at £7.99 (since this error was resolved, next day delivery has been moved to a future project release).

The issue was in the context processor code:

```
next_day_flat_rate = Decimal('7.99')
...
if delivery_option == 'next_day' and can_next_day:
    delivery = next_day_flat_rate
    free_delivery_diff = 0
elif subtotal < settings.FREE_DELIVERY:
    delivery = standard_delivery
    free_delivery_diff = settings.FREE_DELIVERY - subtotal
else:
    delivery = Decimal('0.00')
    free_delivery_diff = 0
```

If the cart is empty, subtotal is 0, so `subtotal < settings.FREE_DELIVERY` is `True`, and when delivery is set to standard delivery.

If the user has selected next day delivery (and is authenticated), delivery is set to next_day_flat_rate (of £7.99), even if the cart is empty.

Added a check to set all totals to zero when the cart is empty:

```
if not cart:
    context = {
        'purchases': [],
        'subtotal': Decimal('0.00'),
        'item_count': 0,
        'total_quantity': 0,
        'delivery_rate': settings.DELIVERY_RATE,
        'delivery': Decimal('0.00'),
        'free_delivery_diff': settings.FREE_DELIVERY,
        'free_delivery_threshold': settings.FREE_DELIVERY,
        'total': Decimal('0.00'),
        'can_next_day': can_next_day,
        'standard_delivery': Decimal('0.00'),
        'next_day_flat_rate': next_day_flat_rate,
        'delivery_option': 'standard',
        'discount_code': '',
        'discount_percent': 0,
        'discount_amount': Decimal('0.00'),
        'sorting_by_copies': sorting_by_copies,
    }
    return context
```

#### [Bug #92](https://github.com/users/dvfrancis/projects/4/views/1?filterQuery=bug&pane=issue&itemId=117518407&issue=dvfrancis%7Cthe-cult-film-club%7C92)

Users without superuser privileges are able to amend stock and discount codes. Only superusers (staff members) should be able to do this.

Added this to the releases and cart views to ensure people are logged in and that only superusers can manage products, and discount codes:

```
from functools import wraps
from django.core.exceptions import PermissionDenied
from django.contrib.auth.views import redirect_to_login


def superuser_required(view_func):
    """
    Decorator for views that ensures the user is both authenticated and a
    superuser.

    - If the user is not authenticated, redirects them to the login page.
    - If the user is authenticated but not a superuser, raises a
      PermissionDenied (403) error.
    - If the user is a superuser, proceeds to the view as normal.

    Example usage:
        @superuser_required
        def my_view(request):
            ...

    Returns:
        function: Wrapped view with access control applied.
    """
    @wraps(view_func)
    def _wrapped_view(request, *args, **kwargs):
        if not request.user.is_authenticated:
            return redirect_to_login(request.get_full_path())
        if not request.user.is_superuser:
            raise PermissionDenied
        return view_func(request, *args, **kwargs)
    return _wrapped_view
```

Above each relevant function I then added:

`@superuser_required`

Now when someone attempts to directly access any of the shop management URL, the site automatically asks them to login and checks they have superuser permissions. If not, they are redirected to the Permission Denied error page.

#### [Bug #93](https://github.com/users/dvfrancis/projects/4/views/1?filterQuery=bug&pane=issue&itemId=118594611&issue=dvfrancis%7Cthe-cult-film-club%7C93)

An error appears in the console when viewing the release details page.

I've added config details for the CKEditor in `settings.py` as suggested in the reference link, and this has resolved the issue:

### Unresolved

#### [Bug #94](https://github.com/users/dvfrancis/projects/4/views/1?filterQuery=bug&pane=issue&itemId=118595000&issue=dvfrancis%7Cthe-cult-film-club%7C94)

This error only appears when the site is deployed to Heroku, but not locally:

"The page ... was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure element ... This request was automatically upgraded to HTTPS, For more information see https://blog.chromium.org/2019/10/no-more-mixed-messages-about-https.html"

I have required that Cloudinary only server secure files in `settings.py` (as shown below), but the error persists:

```
# Cloudinary storage configuration for media files
CLOUDINARY_STORAGE = {
    "CLOUD_NAME": os.getenv("CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME"),
    "API_KEY": os.getenv("CLOUDINARY_API_KEY"),
    "API_SECRET": os.getenv("CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET"),
    "SECURE": True,  # Use secure URLs for media files
}
```
I am unable to resolve this issue - I think it is a problem caused from Cloudinary's side.
