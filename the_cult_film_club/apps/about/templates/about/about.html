                    Streaming might be convenient, but true film lovers know that films deserve more than temporary access.
                    Physical media guarantees lasting ownership—no licensing disputes, no sudden removals, and no
                    corporations dictating what stays or goes. It ensures superior picture quality, untouched by streaming
                    compression, and preserves films exactly as they were meant to be seen.

                    At The Cult Film Club, we are more than just an online shop; we are a movement dedicated to keeping
                    cinema alive in tangible form. Our mission is simple: to ensure cult classics, forgotten gems, and
                    underground masterpieces remain in the hands of collectors who appreciate their artistry, history, and
                    cultural impact.

                <p class="mb-3">
                    With the rise of streaming, countless cult classics have disappeared—tied up in licensing restrictions,
                    stripped from digital libraries, or buried under algorithms that favour mainstream content. At The Cult
                    Film Club, we believe films should be owned, not rented. A true collection stays with you, safe from
                    corporate decisions and digital limitations:

                    At its core, The Cult Film Club is built on a love of cinema that refuses to conform. Some films are
                    more than just entertainment; they challenge norms, spark debate, and deserve preservation. Physical
                    media ensures these treasures are never lost to the whims of streaming services.
